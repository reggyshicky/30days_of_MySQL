--- Returns the average life expectancy of the Continents, We use GROUP BY bcause without the GROUP by clause, the AVG function would calculate the overall average life expectancy across all rows in the countries table and we wouldn't get the continent-wise average life expectancy, which is what we want in this case. The GROUP BY clause allows us to perform the calculation seperately for each continent and get the desired result
SELECT Continent, AVG(LifeExpectancy) FROM country WHERE Continent IN ('Africa', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'North America', 'South America') GROUP BY Continent;
